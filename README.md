Description :
    
   I chose the "Online shopping of shoes - SHOES-STORE" website project, because to get knowledge of HTML elements practically and how we can use them in this project. Building a project using accurate HTML elements among all other elements is a challenging task because there are lots of elements in Html. 
CSS gives a perfect styling and layout to this project, to show the website is beautiful and user loving. 
   I have used four features on my project which shows the shoe collection like party shoes, office shoes, etc. I added four features on the top of the web page in the header tag where we can navigate the whole page using nav and anchor tags. The first feature is the "Home" page which shows an exciting offer of one pair of a shoes with a 50% discount. The second feature is "Next Collections" which  shows up an upcoming collection of shoes with a price. In this section, I used many div as well as image tags to show shoes' color and price.The third and fourth features are Man and women's shoe collections with their name and price of shoes which are specifically defined in section, div, and h2 tags respectively with their specific id attribute. And the ending part is nothing but the footer of  the site which defines in the footer section.
